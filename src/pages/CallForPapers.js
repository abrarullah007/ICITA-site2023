                        the authors’ identification. Therefore, the authors’
                        names, affiliations and bibliographic references should
                        not be included in the version for evaluation by the
                        Program Committee. This information should only be
                        included in the camera-ready version, saved in Word or
                        Latex format and also in PDF format. These files must be
                        accompanied by the filled 'Consent to Publish' form. All
                        files need to compressed e.g., ( a ZIP file), and
                        uploaded at the conference management system.

                        All papers will be subjected to a “double-blind review”

                        Based on Program Committee evaluation, a paper can be
                        rejected or accepted by the Conference Chairs. In the
                        later case, it can be accepted as the type originally
                        submitted or as another type. Thus, full papers can be
                        accepted as short papers or poster papers only.
                        Similarly, short papers can be accepted as poster papers
                        only.

                        the Conference Proceedings, being only presented and
                        discussed. The authors of accepted poster papers should
                        build and print a poster to be exhibited during the
                        Conference. This poster must follow an A1 vertical
                        format. The Conference includes Work Sessions where
                        these posters are presented and orally discussed, with a
                        7-minute limit per poster.

                        to present their work in a Conference Work Session;
                        approximately 5 minutes of discussion will follow each
                        presentation. The authors of accepted Short papers and
                        Company papers will have 10 minutes to present their
                        work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5
                        minutes of discussion will follow each presentation.
